# Assad: The Quest For His Heart
Assad: The Quest For His Heart is a visual novel featuring the main character (who you name because I was too lazy to think of a name) and Bashar al-Assad himself, but without his endorsement.

The game files are in a .zip because GitHub will complain about it being more than 100 files large if it wasn't. Download the zip, extract the zip, extract the zip inside of the zip and you have the source code.

Assad: The Quest For His Heart is created in the Ren'Py visual novel engine. The code can be modified in any script editor but to run the modified code, Ren'Py is required (thankfully Ren'Py is free and open source, much like this game)
